## Hi there! / OlÃ¡!

I'm a programmer from Brazil with interest in various fields of computing, such as:
- High performance computing
- Systems programming
- Embedded systems
- Game development

I loved tinkering with [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/landing) because of how dead simple it was to make things with it. It was how I got into programming in general. Nowadays, I feel like I might appreciate making things âš¡*blazingly fast*âš¡ with Rust or occasionally C++ if I want to suffer, though I do believe I have more experience with it (I wonder why).

I'm a free software advocateâ€”if I even have the right to call myself thatâ€”who daily runs Fedora Workstation on their notebook.
